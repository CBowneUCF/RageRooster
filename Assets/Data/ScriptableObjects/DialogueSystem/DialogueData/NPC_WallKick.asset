  - "<speed=20>Hey, bud, you mind? I\u2019m in the middle of some very important
    business... and right now I\u2019m on my smoke break from said business."
  - "<speed=20>Yeah, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already met one of my brothers, whatever,
    I don\u2019t care. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t even have time to deal with
    you at all. Here, I\u2019ll show you a quick trick so you can get out of my face."

    this on the internet\u2026 but if you do post it, then you DEFINITELY better
    not mention my name\u2026 and if you DO mention my name\u2026 Well damn, not
    cool, bud.<action=upgrade>"

    spend it all in one place. "
