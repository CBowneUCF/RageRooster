    to barely escape with my life and find a safe spot right here in this ditch,
    but there are still plenty more troops ahead. It's only a matter of time til
    they see me\u2026"
  - "<speed=20>Say, you must be quite some fighter to have made it past the cows.
    I\u2019m not much of a fighter myself, but I can teach you an old move that runs
    in the family."
  - "<speed=20> I never really perfected it myself, but I reckon if you made it this
    far you\u2019d get far more use out of it than I ever would anyway.<action=upgrade>"
  - "<speed=20>You go on ahead and clear these bozos out. I\u2019ll stick behind
    until the coast is clear."
