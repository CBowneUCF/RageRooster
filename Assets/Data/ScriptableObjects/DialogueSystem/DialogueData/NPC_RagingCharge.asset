  - <speed=20>Ahhhh, that breeze. That ambience. That... stench. No better place
    to swing a five-iron than these crusty sulfuric steps. Everytime I hit a bogey,
    the mountain grunts back at me, as though the Earth itself has indigestion, but
    little does it know that I am its antacid tablet.
  - "<speed=20>My boys have been runnin\u2019 around, doin\u2019 who knows what\u2026
    but me? I found my peace right here swingin\u2019 iron and slammin\u2019 birdies.
    I\u2019ve finally reached a state of zen. I mean, I don\u2019t even feel the
    need to charge headfirst into those boulders over there in one of my world-famous
    fits of inconsolable rage."
  - "<speed=20>I can just leave that to anyone else out there who\u2019s crazy enough
    to try it; I figure this world is in no short supply, and thankfully it runs
    in the family anyway.<action=upgrade>"
  - <speed=20>Hmmmm, what? Is someone there?
