    to swing a five-iron than these crusty sulfuric steps. '

    the Earth itself has indigestion\u2026 but little does it know that I am its
    antacid tablet\u2026.\r \n \r\n"
  - <speed=20> My boys have been running around, doin who knows what... but me? I
    found my peace right here, swingin iron and slammin birdies.
  - "<speed=20> I mean, I don\u2019t even feel the need to charge headfirst into
    those boulders over there in one of my world-famous fits of inconsolable rage."
  - "<speed=20>I can just leave that to anyone else out there who\u2019s crazy enough
    to try it; I figure this world is in no short supply, and thankfully it runs
    in the family anyway.<action=upgrade>"
